* Estimates ATE (Average Treatment Effect), ATT (Average Treatment Effect on the Treated), and ATC (Average Treatment Effect for the Controls)
* Renders Diagnostic plots of convergence, individual effects, and overlap
* Conducts sensitivity analysis

## Steps
* Trim dataset so it only includes confounders (X), treatment (Y), response (Z), and ID column (optional)
* Convert and save dataset into .csv file
* Click Upload panel on top of the page and choose the file path to upload dataset
